Introduction

a)Our group is called Uncoded. We consist of 4 talented software developers who are going to create software that involves managing and facilitating small institutions access to curricula that are affiliated with Hyperion distance learning. 

Background:
b)    Home schooling is an alternative to  traditional  attending public or private schools where a parent of a learner may provide education for their own children at  home. One of the reasons parents give for homeschooling include concerns about safety, religious preference, and educational benefits.In addition, families homeschool to accommodate special needs and learning difficulties. 
      The rapid technological advances made over the past decade have transformed distance learning into an exciting study option for many students, both in South Africa and internationally.Distance learning is suited to students who want to study from wherever they are, without having to attend classes in person at a venue. Other than the requirement to submit assessment tasks on time, distance learning offers the student flexibility to plan his/her own study schedule.Distance learning is ideal for students that travel a lot in one year or live in remote areas and have no schools that are easily accessible. 
      Our sponsor is called Hyperion Distance Learning and they provide curricula to students via smaller institutions and homeschools through a mixture of  physical and digital resources.They cater for various clients e.g students who are looking for a better learning  environment compared to traditional schools,parents who prefer to teach their children until grade 9 but do not have a curriculum and a way to deliver it, special needs students  or students who are playing a sport for a national teams and are always traveling.

Current systems
c)     Hyperion's current systems heavily involve the use of emails to distribute assessments and other relevant documents. Results are  recorded via excel spreadsheets which get sent to the Hyperion facilitators.
      Reports are manually generated and emailed to their respective clients.They have a static website which  provides the different curriculum packages they offer.A client has to email them to purchase a curriculum package.All digital resources such as assignments, exams, assessments and statements are sent to the clients via email.They currently use excel to record assessment results, student information and account balances.
